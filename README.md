# Curiocity

## Authors
* Amy Wong

## Purpose
* Curiocity is an app designed to make planning trips easy.

## Features
* Ability to view destinations on a map
* Find popular tourist attractions
* Group destinations 

## Control Flow
* Users are initially presented with a screen where they can start a travel plan for a city of their choosing or view a travel plan they have already made.
* When a new plan for a city is created, a list of recommended attractions are presented in a checklist and the user can choose which attractions to add to their plan.
* Users can also add attractions that were not on the checklist.
* Tapping to go to the next page shows a map with all the pins of locations previously selected. The locations appear as pins of different colors, so if locations are closer to each other, they will have the same color pin.
* The next page shows the list of locations based on pin color, and it will show the opening/closing hours and the Yelp ratings.
